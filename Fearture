# GCP Cloud Hub and App Hub: Value Proposition and Onboarding Guide

## Executive Summary

Google Cloud Platform's App Hub and Cloud Hub provide a comprehensive application-centric approach to organizing, managing, and monitoring cloud resources. These services enable DevOps, SRE, and operations teams to move beyond project-based resource management to application-focused governance and operations at scale.

## What is App Hub?

App Hub is Google Cloud's application-centric resource organization service that enables teams to group infrastructure resources from one or more Google Cloud projects into logical applications. It automatically discovers infrastructure resources and represents them as service and workload abstractions that can be registered into applications.

## What is Cloud Hub?

Cloud Hub provides DevOps and SRE teams with a centralized operational dashboard that consolidates operations data and insights across Google Cloud applications and resources. It serves as a single pane of glass for monitoring health, performance, capacity, incidents, and support information.

## Value Proposition for DevOps and SRE Teams

### 1. Application-Centric Operations
- **Business Alignment**: Organize resources the same way teams think about business functionalities rather than technical project boundaries
- **Cross-Project Visibility**: Manage applications that span multiple Google Cloud projects from a single interface
- **Simplified Governance**: Apply business logic and policies at the application level with clear ownership boundaries

### 2. Enhanced Operational Efficiency
- **Centralized Monitoring**: View logs, metrics, incidents, and alerts for entire applications in one location
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understand how services and workloads within applications depend on each other
- **Resource Discovery**: Automatic discovery of infrastructure resources eliminates manual inventory management

### 3. Improved Incident Response
- **Unified Dashboard**: Cloud Hub consolidates active Google Cloud incidents, maintenance activities, monitoring alerts, and support cases
- **Application Context**: Quickly identify which applications are affected by infrastructure issues
- **Performance Insights**: Access health and performance metrics with application-level context

### 4. Scalable Governance
